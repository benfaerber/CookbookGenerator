# CookbookGenerator
A python tool that creates recipe webpages. I organize all my favorite recipes using this.

To get started run recipe.py, it creates the pages into the Book directory.
My book directory contains a few of my favorite recipes so enjoy!

Catalog.py is run at the end of the recipe script so don't bother running it.
